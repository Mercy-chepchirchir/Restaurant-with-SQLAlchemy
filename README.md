# Restaurant-with-SQLAlchemy
Here you will work with three classes: `Restaurant`, `Customer`, and `Review`.The relationships between these models are defined as follows: a Restaurant has many Reviews, a Customer has many Reviews, and a Review belongs to both a Restaurant and a Customer. The code challenge contains several tasks, including setting up migrations, implementing object relationship methods, and creating aggregate and relationship methods.
